# HackerRank Python Challenges – 5⭐ Journey

This repository contains my personal solutions to various HackerRank challenges using Python.  
It serves as a demonstration of my coding style, logical thinking, and problem-solving approach.

## Purpose

- To document my journey toward earning 5 stars in multiple HackerRank domains.
- To showcase my skills and mindset to potential freelance clients and collaborators.
- To practice, improve, and share clean, effective Python code for algorithms and data structures.

## Topics Covered

- Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
- Data Structures (lists, queues, dictionaries, etc.)
- Strings and text manipulation
- Mathematics and logic
- Other HackerRank domains as I progress

## File Structure

Each `.py` file is named after the challenge it solves.  
Comments inside the code explain my thought process and solution strategy.
